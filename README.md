# Exploration Guide🌎
This site is a pretty simple page to operate through because it taps into a consumer's intuitive nature. Every thing is pretty easy to follow and identfy. This Weather Dashboard allows a user to type in any city in the world and receive a daily weather forecast and 5 day forecast for the week of. Not sure if any of this would be possible without using the Openweathermap API, so I'm giving a big shoutout to them for doing the hard part 🥲. This site allows a user to see their search history as well as clear out their history with the click of the button.
